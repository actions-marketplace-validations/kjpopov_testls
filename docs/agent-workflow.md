# Agent workflow

How AI agents run the PR loop on `testls` with the `gh` CLI and CodeRabbit.
Only follow this when the maintainer has allowed `gh` for the session;
otherwise push branches and stop (see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)).

## Loop per roadmap item

1. Branch from an up-to-date `main` (`git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`).
2. Split the item into small PRs, usually **wire/data → probe → checks →
   report/CLI** (docs, `docs/json-schema.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, PLAN checkbox and
   decision log go into the last PR).
3. Before pushing: everything in AGENTS.md "Before you push", plus
   integration tests for scanner changes.
4. `git push -u origin BRANCH`, then
   `gh pr create --base main --title "area: subject" --body "..."`.
5. Wait for CI and CodeRabbit (5-10 min), fix comments, repeat. One review
   round = one fix commit (see "Answering comments").
6. Merge when green and CodeRabbit is happy (see below):
   `gh pr merge N --merge --delete-branch`, then pull `main`.

Stacked branches: open the PR for the next layer only after the lower one is
merged, then `git rebase origin/main` (or `git rebase --onto origin/main OLD`)
so the PR always targets `main`. CodeRabbit auto-reviews only PRs whose base
is `main`; never target another feature branch (an earlier PR got merged into
its parent branch by mistake).

## Checking status

```sh
gh pr checks N                      # CodeRabbit row: pending -> "Review completed"
gh pr view N --json mergeStateStatus --jq .mergeStateStatus   # CLEAN = ready
```

Reviews, including **outside-diff and nitpick comments, which appear only in
the review body**, and reviews by the maintainer:

```sh
gh api repos/kjpopov/testls/pulls/N/reviews --jq '.[]
  | select(.user.login != "kjpopov" or (.body | length) > 0)
  | .user.login + " " + .commit_id[:7] + " "
    + (.body | capture("Actionable comments posted: (?<n>[0-9]+)").n // "none")
    + " " + (.body | test("Outside diff|Nitpick") | tostring)'
gh api repos/kjpopov/testls/pulls/N/reviews/ID --jq .body   # read one body
```

Inline comments (save to a file, then `jq`, to avoid shell quoting issues):

```sh
mkdir -p target
gh api repos/kjpopov/testls/pulls/N/comments > target/prN.json
jq -r '.[] | (.id|tostring) + " " + .path + ":" + (.line|tostring)' target/prN.json
```

CodeRabbit is happy when either:

- its latest verdict (last non-`COMMENTED` review) is `APPROVED`, its
  `commit_id` equals `headRefOid`, and the merge state is `CLEAN`:

  ```sh
  gh pr view N --json headRefOid,mergeStateStatus
  gh api --paginate --slurp repos/kjpopov/testls/pulls/N/reviews | jq -r '[.[][]
    | select(.user.login == "coderabbitai[bot]" and .state != "COMMENTED")]
    | last | .state + " " + .commit_id'
  ```

- or, when it withholds approval (merge risk above `low`, see
  `.coderabbit.yaml`, or an explained pre-merge check failure), the latest commit's review has no actionable comments,
  all CodeRabbit threads are resolved, `gh pr checks` shows "Review
  completed" and the merge state is `CLEAN`;
  mention the risk to the maintainer.

Auto-approval also needs resolved threads and passing pre-merge checks
(title, changelog, JSON schema, docstrings; listed in the summary comment).
They are in warning mode, so GitHub never blocks on them, but a failing one
may withhold approval. Fix it if you can; if you explain it in a PR comment
instead, the PR may merge without approval under the second rule above, and
you must point the maintainer to the explanation. Always read every
review body before merging: a maintainer `TODO` review was once missed.

## Answering comments

- Collect every comment of a round (inline, outside-diff, nitpick) first,
  then push **all fixes in one commit**: each push triggers a review and the
  plan allows 10 reviews per hour. Each inline comment has a "Prompt for AI
  Agents" section; use it as the fix spec, but verify against the code.
- Fix in a new commit (don't force-push over reviewed commits), then reply:
  `gh api repos/kjpopov/testls/pulls/N/comments/ID/replies -f body="Fixed in abc1234: ..."`.
- Outside-diff/nitpick items have no thread: answer with `gh pr comment N -b "..."`.
- Declining is fine with a reason (RFC citation, scope); CodeRabbit usually
  accepts, resolves the thread and stores a learning so it won't ask again.
- CodeRabbit resolves threads after a fix reply. Leftovers:
  `gh api graphql -f query='{repository(owner:"kjpopov",name:"testls"){pullRequest(number:N){reviewThreads(first:50){nodes{id isResolved}}}}}'`
  then `gh api graphql -f query='mutation{resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:"ID"}){thread{isResolved}}}'`.
- If CodeRabbit pauses or skips: `gh pr comment N -b "@coderabbitai review"`.
- To preview `.coderabbit.yaml` changes, mark the PR as draft
  (`gh pr ready N --undo`) and comment `@coderabbitai review --preview-config`.
  Keep it draft until CodeRabbit posts the preview, then `gh pr ready N`.

## Waiting

Use `sleep 240` with a tool timeout of 300000 ms; longer sleeps hit the
timeout. Work on the next branch while a review runs.

## Releases

1. Release PR `chore/release-X.Y.Z`: version in `Cargo.toml` (workspace and
   internal `=X.Y.Z` deps), `cargo update -w --offline`, `fuzz/Cargo.lock`,
   `CHANGELOG.md` section with date and compare links, version in the
   examples of `README.md`, `docs/install.md` and `docs/github-action.md`,
   PLAN "Released as vX.Y.Z".
2. After merge: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "testls vX.Y.Z" MERGE_SHA && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
3. `release.yml` builds five targets, publishes the GitHub release and pushes
   the container image to `ghcr.io/kjpopov/testls` (after the first push the
   maintainer makes the package public in its settings, once); check
   with `gh run list --workflow release.yml` and `gh release view vX.Y.Z`.
4. Its `crates-io` job then publishes the workspace with crates.io trusted
   publishing. Maintainer setup, once: publish the first version by hand
   (`cargo publish --workspace`), add trusted publishing for
   `kjpopov/testls`, workflow `release.yml`, environment `crates-io` to
   every `testls*` crate on crates.io, create that GitHub environment, and
   set the repository variable `CRATES_IO_TRUSTED_PUBLISHING=true`. Until
   then the job is skipped. If it fails halfway, rerun it: crates already
   published at that version are skipped. Agents never publish to crates.io.
5. Packages PR `chore/packages-X.Y.Z` once the release exists:
   `gh release download vX.Y.Z -p SHA256SUMS -O target/SHA256SUMS` and
   `python3 scripts/gen-packages.py target/SHA256SUMS` update `Formula/`,
   `bucket/` and `packaging/winget/`. After merge, tell the maintainer to
   submit `packaging/winget/X.Y.Z/` to `microsoft/winget-pkgs` (for example
   with `wingetcreate submit`).
6. Marketplace: the maintainer edits the GitHub release and ticks "Publish
   this Action to the GitHub Marketplace". GitHub checks `action.yml` at the
   tag, and its `name` must be unique across actions, users and
   organizations (`testls` is taken). The Marketplace page shows the root
   `README.md`, so it leads with the action and links to
   `docs/github-action.md`. Publish on the release the workflow created;
   creating a new release in the web UI makes a new tag (v0.4.2 that way
   had no build).

## Things learned the hard way

- OCSP fixtures are gitignored: run `scripts/gen-ocsp-fixtures.sh` after a
  fresh checkout or `cargo test` fails in `testls-checks`.
- Check `git branch --show-current` before committing when juggling stacked
  branches.
- Run the MSRV check from AGENTS.md when `rustup` is available. Without it
  (as on the current development Mac) `cargo +1.97` fails; say so in the PR
  and rely on the CI `msrv` job.
- clippy `too_many_lines` (100) bites `main.rs` and long JSON test
  fixtures; extract helpers or compact expected JSON.
- The test servers' CA key was discarded; certificates needing a CA we
  control are generated by scripts or committed as static fixtures.
- CodeRabbit posts a `COMMENTED` review, then a separate `APPROVED` one
  for the same commit; when approval is expected, wait for both before
  judging a round. If approval is withheld (risk above `low` or a failed
  pre-merge check), use the second rule under "Checking status".
- Approved rounds can still carry "Outside diff range" comments in the
  review body; they have no thread, so only reading the body finds them.
- `@coderabbitai review --preview-config` on a non-draft PR does nothing;
  a config on the PR branch is applied anyway ("Layers: Repository YAML").
- Mention clean-room sources (RFC/IANA section) in every new data table or
  check.
- CodeRabbit can set `CHANGES_REQUESTED` for a single Minor comment; a
  later `APPROVED` review on the head commit replaces it.
- The single-comment endpoint is `repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/comments/ID`,
  without the PR number.
- CodeRabbit can withhold approval citing a concern it already withdrew
  or accepted in a thread; the "Automatic approval withheld" note is not
  updated. Resolve the thread, explain in a PR comment and use the second
  rule under "Checking status".
